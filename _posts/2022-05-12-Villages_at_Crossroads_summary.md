# Kim Min Chul, Villages at Crossroads: Colonial Power and Rural Society (2012), Summary

## The Reason for Reading This Book

I was investigating the reason why some counties ('gun', 郡) built more Japanese Shinto shrines called 'Shinshi' (神祠) than other counties in colonial Korea (Colonial Joseon). While investigating, I became aware of the fact that, for the colonial administration, it would be much easier to build shrines inside or as annexes of the elementary school which were already distributed at least one per town ('myeon', 面) at the point of time in 1936 instead of the detached Shinto shrines. The construction costs will be largely saved and thus conflicts between members of the town that can stem from the imputed costs could be prevented. Actually, there were many cases that the Japanese national symbols were worshiped in elementary schools. Thus, the authority does not necessarily want to spend more money in constructing Shinshi.

At first, I thought that this means that the difference of construction rate between towns cannot be explained solely by the necessity of construction from the perspective of the authority. Instead, I turned my sight to the power game within a town or a county. If the power game inside the domain is involved in this matter, the cost may not be payed by the authority but one of the powers inside the domain. Secondly, there may be possibilities that detached Shinto shrines have more value than the shrines established inside or as annexes of elementary schools, such as more symbolic power can be drawn by the former. To figure out more, I selected this book to have deeper understanding in the inside story of towns and villages.
